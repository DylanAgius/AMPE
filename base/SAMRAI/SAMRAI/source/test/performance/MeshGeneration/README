Performance tests for mesh generations.

The two bottle-neck steps (clustering and partitioning) are tested here for:

* run-time performance

* quality of generated metadata

We don't test all steps in mesh generation or remeshing here, just the
most expensive steps.  These steps have the same characteristics
whether generating the mesh or remeshing, so we omit remesh-specific
steps.
