\section{The SPBCG module}\label{ss:spbcg}

The {\spbcg} package, in the files \id{sundials\_spbcgs.h} and \id{sundials\_spbcgs.c}, includes an
implementation of the scaled preconditioned Bi-CGStab\index{Bi-CGStab method} method.  
For full details, including usage instructions, see the file \id{sundials\_spbcgs.h}.
\index{SPBCG@{\spbcg} generic linear solver!description of|)}

{\warn}The {\spbcg} package can only be used in conjunction with an actual {\nvector} 
implementation library, such as the {\nvecs} or {\nvecp} provided with {\sundials}.

The files needed to use the {\spbcg} module by itself are the same as for the
{\spgmr} module, with \id{sundials\_spbcgs.(h,c)} replacing \id{sundials\_spgmr.(h,c)}.

\subsection{Functions}
\index{SPBCG@{\spbcg} generic linear solver!functions|(}
The following functions are available in the {\spbcg} package:  
\begin{itemize}
\item \id{SpbcgMalloc}: allocation of memory for \id{SpbcgSolve};
\item \id{SpbcgSolve}: solution of $Ax = b$ by the {\spbcg} method;
\item \id{SpbcgFree}: free memory allocated by \id{SpbcgMalloc}.
\end{itemize}
