The {\sundials} suite (or individual solvers) are distributed as compressed archives
(\id{.tar.gz}). The name of the distribution archive is of the form {\em solver}\id{-x.y.z.tar.gz},
where {\em solver} is one of: \id{sundials}, \id{cvode}, \id{cvodes}, \id{ida}, or \id{kinsol},
and \id{x.y.z} represents the version number (of the {\sundials} suite or of the individual solver).

To begin the installation, first uncompress and expand the sources, by issuing
\begin{verbatim}
   % tar xzf solver-x.y.z.tar.gz
\end{verbatim}
This will extract source files under a directory {\em solver}\id{-x.y.z}.


\vspace{0.25in}

\noindent A few observations:

\begin{itemize}

\item starting with version \id{2.5.0}, two installation methods are provided: in addition to the previous autotools-based
method, {\sundials} now provides a method based on CMake. Both approaches are described in detail in the following sections.

\item The installation of examples follows a new philosophy:
If examples are enabled by the user, "make" will build all pertinent examples together with the {\sundials} libraries, but "make install"
will export (in a subdirectory of the installation directory) the example sources and sample outputs together with automatically generated
configuration files that reference the installed {\sundials} headers and libraries (and which can therefore be used as "templates" for your
own problems). The configure script will install makefiles. CMake installs \id{CMakeLists.txt} files and also (as an option available only under Unix/Linux)
makefiles. Note that the exported example makefiles are generated from templates (also included in the attached tarball).

\item No matter the installtion procedure, even if generation of shared libraries is enabled, only static libraries are created for the FCMIX modules
(due to the use of fixed names for the Fortran user-provided subroutines, FCMIX shared libraries would result in "undefined symbol"
errors at link time).

\item Since the CMake based build system is fairly new and has only been tested under Linux and Windows (and there only for VC8 and the Intel Compiler)
any feedback on how it works on other platforms is appreciated

\end{itemize}


\noindent In the remainder of this chapter, we make the following distinctions:
\begin{itemize}

\item {\em srcdir} 

  is the directory {\em solver}\id{-x.y.z} created above; i.e., the 
  directory containing the {\sundials} sources.

\item {\em builddir}

  is the directory under which {\sundials} is built. This can be the same as
  {\em srcdir}, although out-of-source builds are recommended.

\item {\em instdir}

  is the directory under which the {\sundials} exported header files
  and libraries will be installed. Typically, header files are exported under a directory
  {\em instdir}\id{/include} while libraries are installed under {\em instdir}\id{/lib},
  with {\em instdir} specified at configuration time.

\end{itemize}
{\noindent}{\warn}{\em Note}: The installation directory {\em instdir} should {\em not} be the same as
the source directory {\em srcdir}.

\section{Autotools-based installation}

% ========================================================================================


The installation procedure outlined below will work on commodity {\linux}/{\unix} 
systems without modification. However, users are still encouraged to carefully read 
the entire chapter before attempting to install the {\sundials} suite, in case
non-default choices are desired for compilers, compilation options, or the like.
In lieu of reading the option list below, the user may invoke the configuration
script with the help flag to view a complete listing of available options, which
may be done by issuing 
\begin{verbatim}
   % ./configure --help 
\end{verbatim}
from within {\em srcdir}.


\vspace{0.2in}
{\noindent}The installation steps for {\sundials} can be as simple as 
\begin{verbatim}
   % tar xzf solver-x.y.z.tar.gz
   % cd solver-x.y.z
   % ./configure
   % make
   % make install
\end{verbatim}
in which case the {\sundials} header files and libraries are installed under \id{/usr/local/include}
and \id{/usr/local/lib}, respectively. Note that, by default, neither the example programs nor the 
{\sundialsTB} toolbox are built and installed.

If disk space is a priority, then to delete all temporary files created by building {\sundials}, issue
\begin{verbatim}
   % make clean
\end{verbatim}

To prepare the {\sundials} distribution for a new install (using, for example, different options and/or
installation destinations), issue
\begin{verbatim}
   % make distclean
\end{verbatim}

%===============================================================================

\subsection{Configuration options}\label{ss:configuration_options}

The installation procedure given above will generally work without modification;
however, if the system includes multiple {\mpi} implementations, then certain
configure script-related options may be used to indicate which {\mpi}
implementation should be used. Also, if the user wants to use non-default
language compilers, then, again, the necessary shell environment variables must
be appropriately redefined.
%%
The remainder of this section provides explanations of available configure script
options.


\subsubsection*{General options}

%%
%% General options
%%

\begin{config}
  
\item \id{--prefix=PREFIX}
  
  Location for architecture-independent files.
  
  Default: \id{PREFIX=}{/usr/local}
  
\item \id{--exec-prefix=EPREFIX}

  Location for architecture-dependent files.
  
  Default: \id{EPREFIX=}{/usr/local}

\item \id{--includedir=DIR}
  
  Alternate location for installation of header files.
  
  Default: \id{DIR=PREFIX/include}
  
\item \id{--libdir=DIR}
  
  Alternate location for installation of libraries.
  
  Default: \id{DIR=EPREFIX/lib}

\item \id{--disable-}{\em solver}

  Although each existing solver module is built by default, support for a
  given solver can be explicitly disabled using this option. 
  The valid values for {\em solver} are: \id{cvode}, \id{cvodes}, 
  \id{ida}, and \id{kinsol}.

\item \id{--enable-examples}
  
  Available example programs are {\em not} built by default. Use this option
  to enable compilation of all pertinent example programs. Upon completion of 
  the \id{make} command, the example executables will be created under solver-specific
  subdirectories of {\em builddir}\id{/examples}:
  \begin{config}
  \item {\em builddir}\id{/examples/}{\em solver}\id{/serial} : serial {\C} examples
  \item {\em builddir}\id{/examples/}{\em solver}\id{/parallel} : parallel {\C} examples
  \item {\em builddir}\id{/examples/}{\em solver}\id{/fcmix\_serial} : serial {\F} examples
  \item {\em builddir}\id{/examples/}{\em solver}\id{/fcmix\_parallel} : parallel {\F} examples
  \end{config}  
  {\em Note}: Some of these subdirectories may not exist depending upon the
  solver and/or the configuration options given.

\item \id{--with-examples-instdir=EXINSTDIR}

  Alternate location for example executables and sample output files (valid only if
  examples are enabled). Note that installtion of example files can be completely disabled
  by issuing \id{EXINSTDIR=no} (in case building the examples is desired only as a test of
  the {\sundials} libraries).

  Default: \id{DIR=EPREFIX/examples}

\item \id{--with-cppflags=ARG}

  Specify additional {\C} preprocessor flags 
  (e.g., \id{ARG=-I<include\_dir>} if necessary header files are located in
   nonstandard locations).

\item \id{--with-cflags=ARG}

  Specify additional {\C} compilation flags.

\item \id{--with-ldflags=ARG}

  Specify additional linker flags (e.g., \id{ARG=-L<lib\_dir>} if
  required libraries are located in nonstandard locations).

\item \id{--with-libs=ARG}

  Specify additional libraries to be used (e.g., \id{ARG=-l<foo>} to
  link with the library named \id{libfoo.a} or \id{libfoo.so}).

\item \id{--with-precision=ARG}

  By default, {\sundials} will define a real number (internally referred to as
  \id{realtype}) to be a double-precision floating-point numeric data type
  (\id{double} {\C}-type); however, this option may be used to build {\sundials}
  with \id{realtype} alternatively defined as a single-precision floating-point
  numeric data type (\id{float} {\C}-type) if \id{ARG=single}, or as a
  \id{long double} {\C}-type if \\ \id{ARG=extended}.

  Default: \id{ARG=double}

  {\warn}Users should {\em not} build {\sundials} with support for
  single-precision floating-point arithmetic on 32- or 64-bit systems.
  This will almost certainly result in unreliable numerical solutions.
  The configuration option \id{--with-precision=single} is intended for
  systems on which single-precision arithmetic involves at least 14 decimal
  digits.

\end{config}

%%
%% Fortran support
%%

\subsubsection*{Options for Fortran support}

\begin{config}

\item \id{--disable-fcmix}

  Using this option will disable all {\F} support. The {\fcvode},
  {\fkinsol}, {\fida}, and {\fnvector} modules will not be built,
  regardless of availability.

\item \id{--with-fflags=ARG}

  Specify additional {\F} compilation flags.

\end{config}

\noindent The configuration script will attempt to automatically determine the
function name mangling scheme required by the specified {\F} compiler, but the
following two options may be used to override the default behavior.

\begin{config}

\item \id{--with-f77underscore=ARG}

  This option pertains to the {\fcvode}, {\fkinsol}, {\fida}, and {\fnvector}
  {\F}-{\C} interface modules and is used to specify the number of underscores to
  append to function names so {\F} routines can properly link with the associated
  {\sundials} libraries. Valid values for \id{ARG} are: \id{none}, \id{one}
  and \id{two}.

  Default: \id{ARG=one}

\item \id{--with-f77case=ARG}

  Use this option to specify whether the external names of the {\fcvode},
  {\fkinsol}, {\fida}, and {\fnvector} {\F}-{\C} interface functions should be
  lowercase or uppercase so {\F} routines can properly link with the associated
  {\sundials} libraries. Valid values for \id{ARG} are: \id{lower} and \id{upper}.

  Default: \id{ARG=lower}

\end{config}


%%
%% Parallel options
%%

\subsubsection*{Options for MPI support}

\noindent The following configuration options are only applicable to the parallel
{\sundials} packages:

\begin{config}
  
\item \id{--disable-mpi}

  Using this option will completely disable {\mpi} support.

\item \id{--with-mpicc=ARG}
\item \id{--with-mpif77=ARG}

  By default, the configuration utility script will use the {\mpi} compiler
  scripts named \id{mpicc} and \id{mpif77} to compile the parallelized
  {\sundials} subroutines; however, for reasons of compatibility, different
  executable names may be specified via the above options. Also, \id{ARG=no}
  can be used to disable the use of {\mpi} compiler scripts, thus causing
  the serial {\C} and {\F} compilers to be used to compile the parallelized
  {\sundials} functions and examples.

\item \id{--with-mpi-root=MPIDIR}

  This option may be used to specify which {\mpi} implementation should be used.
  The {\sundials} configuration script will automatically check under the
  subdirectories \id{MPIDIR/include} and \id{MPIDIR/lib} for the necessary
  header files and libraries. The subdirectory \id{MPIDIR/bin} will also be
  searched for the {\C} and {\F} {\mpi} compiler scripts, unless the user uses
  \id{--with-mpicc=no} or \id{--with-mpif77=no}.

\item \id{--with-mpi-incdir=INCDIR}
\item \id{--with-mpi-libdir=LIBDIR}
\item \id{--with-mpi-libs=LIBS}

  These options may be used if the user would prefer not to use a preexisting
  {\mpi} compiler script, but instead would rather use a serial complier and
  provide the flags necessary to compile the {\mpi}-aware subroutines in
  {\sundials}.

  Often an {\mpi} implementation will have unique library names and so it may
  be necessary to specify the appropriate libraries to use (e.g.,
  \id{LIBS=-lmpich}).

  Default: \id{INCDIR=MPIDIR/include} and \id{LIBDIR=MPIDIR/lib}

\item \id{--with-mpi-flags=ARG}

  Specify additional {\mpi}-specific flags.

\end{config}


\subsubsection*{Options for library support}
%%
%% Shared or Static Libraries
%%

\noindent By default, only static libraries are built, but the following option
may be used to build shared libraries on supported platforms.

\begin{config}

\item \id{--enable-shared}

  Using this particular option will result in both static and shared versions of
  the available {\sundials} libraries being built if the system supports shared
  libraries. To build only shared libraries also specify \id{--disable-static}.

  {\em Note}: The {\fcvode}, {\fkinsol}, and {\fida} libraries can only be built as
  static libraries because they contain references to externally defined symbols,
  namely user-supplied {\F} subroutines.  Although the {\F} interfaces to the serial
  and parallel implementations of the supplied {\nvector} module do not contain any
  unresolvable external symbols, the libraries are still built as static libraries
  for the purpose of consistency.

\end{config}


\subsubsection*{Options for Matlab support}
%%
%% Compilation of sundialsTB mex files
%%

\noindent The following options are relevant only for configuring and building 
the {\sundialsTB} Matlab toolbox:

\begin{config}

\item \id{--enable-sundialsTB}

  The {\sundialsTB} Matlab toolbox is {\em not} built by default. Use this option
  to enable configuration and compilation of the \id{mex} files. Upon completion
  of the \id{make} command, the following \id{mex} files will be created:
  \begin{config}
    \item {\em builddir}\id{/sundialsTB/cvodes/cvm/cvm.}{\em{mexext}}
    \item {\em builddir}\id{/sundialsTB/idas/idm/idm.}{\em{mexext}}
    \item {\em builddir}\id{/sundialsTB/kinsol/kim/kim.}{\em{mexext}}
  \end{config}
  where {\em mexext} is the platform-specific extension of \id{mex} files.
  
\item \id{--with-sundialsTB-instdir=STBINSTDIR}

  Alternate location for the installed {\sundialsTB} toolbox (valid only if
  {\sundialsTB} is enabled). As for the example programs, installation of {\sundialsTB} can 
  be completely disabled by issuing \id{STBINSTDIR=no} (in case building the toolbox is desired 
  but its installtion will be done manually afterwards). Otherwise, all required {\sundialsTB} 
  files will be installed under the directory \id{STBINSTDIR/sundialsTB}.

  Default: \id{DIR=MATLAB/toolbox}  (see below for the definition of \id{MATLAB}).

\item \id{--with-matlab=MATLAB}

  This option can be used to specify the location of the Matlab executable. 
  The default is to search the path.

\item \id{--with-mexopts=ARG}

  Specify the \id{mex} options file to be used.

  Default: Standard Matlab \id{mex} options file.

\item \id{--with-mexflags=ARG}

  Specify the \id{mex} compiler flags to be used.

  Default: \id{ARG=-O}

\item \id{--with-mexldadd=ARG}

  Specify additional \id{mex} linker flags.

  Default: none

\end{config}


\subsubsection*{Environment variables}

%%
%% Environment variables
%%

\noindent The following environment variables can be locally (re)defined for use 
during the configuration of {\sundials}. See the next section for
illustrations of these.

\begin{config}

\item \id{CC}

\item \id{F77}

  Since the configuration script uses the first {\C} and {\F} compilers found in
  the current executable search path, then each relevant shell variable (\id{CC}
  and \id{F77}) must be locally (re)defined in order to use a different compiler. 
  For example, to use \id{xcc} (executable name of chosen compiler) as the {\C}
  language compiler, use \id{CC=xcc} in the configure step.

\item \id{CFLAGS}

\item \id{FFLAGS}

  Use these environment variables to override the default {\C} and {\F}
  compilation flags.

\end{config}


%%===============================================================================


\subsection{Configuration examples}

The following examples are meant to help demonstrate proper usage of the configure options.


To build {\sundials} using the default C and Fortran compilers,
and default \id{mpicc} and \id{mpif77} parallel compilers, enable compilation of examples,
build the Matlab \id{mex} files for {\sundialsTB}, and install it under 
\id{/home/myname/matlab/sundialsTB}, use
\begin{verbatim}
   % configure --prefix=/home/myname/sundials --enable-examples \
               --enable-sundialsTB --with-sundialsTB-instdir=/home/myname/matlab
\end{verbatim}


\noindent To disable installation of the examples, use:
\begin{verbatim}
   % configure --prefix=/home/myname/sundials \
               --enable-examples --with-examples-instdir=no \
               --enable-sundialsTB --with-sundialsTB-instdir=/home/myname/matlab
\end{verbatim}


\noindent The following example builds {\sundials} using \id{gcc} as the serial {\C}
compiler, \id{g77} as the serial {\F} compiler, \id{mpicc} as the parallel {\C}
compiler, \id{mpif77} as the parallel {\F} compiler, and appends the \id{-g3}
compilaton flag to the list of default flags:
\begin{verbatim}
   % configure CC=gcc F77=g77 --with-cflags=-g3 --with-fflags=-g3 \
               --with-mpicc=/usr/apps/mpich/1.2.4/bin/mpicc \ 
               --with-mpif77=/usr/apps/mpich/1.2.4/bin/mpif77
\end{verbatim}


\noindent The next example again builds {\sundials} using \id{gcc} as the serial
{\C} compiler, but the \id{--with-mpicc=no} option explicitly disables the use
of the corresponding {\mpi} compiler script. In addition, since the 
\id{--with-mpi-root} option is given, the compilation flags
\id{-I/usr/apps/mpich/1.2.4/include} and \id{-L/usr/apps/mpich/1.2.4/lib} are passed
to \id{gcc} when compiling the {\mpi}-enabled functions. 
The \id{--disable-examples} option explicitly disables the examples (which means
a {\F} compiler is not required).
The \id{--with-mpi-libs} option is required so that the configure
script can check if \id{gcc} can link with the appropriate {\mpi}
library.
\begin{verbatim}
   % configure CC=gcc --disable-examples --with-mpicc=no \
               --with-mpi-root=/usr/apps/mpich/1.2.4 \
               --with-mpi-libs=-lmpich
\end{verbatim}




%%===============================================================================

\subsection{Building SUNDIALS without the configure script}\label{ss:no_config}

If the \id{configure} script cannot be used ({\em e.g.}, when building
{\sundials} under Microsoft Windows without using Cygwin), or if the
user prefers to own the build process ({\em e.g.}, when {\sundials} is
incorporated into a larger project with its own build system), then
the header and source files for a given module can be copied from the
{\em srcdir} to some other location and compiled separately.

The following files are required to compile a {\sundials} solver module:
\begin{itemize}
\item public header files located under 
{\em srcdir}\id{/include/}{\em solver}
\item implementation header files and source files located under
{\em srcdir}\id{/src/}{\em solver}
\item (optional) {\F}/{\C} interface files located under
{\em srcdir}\id{/src/}{\em solver}\id{/fcmix}
\item shared public header files located under
{\em srcdir}\id{/include/sundials}
\item shared source files located under
{\em srcdir}\id{/src/sundials}
\item (optional) {\nvecs} header and source files located under
{\em srcdir}\id{/include/nvector} and {\em srcdir}\id{/src/nvec\_ser} 
\item (optional) {\nvecp} header and source files located under
{\em srcdir}\id{/include/nvector} and {\em srcdir}\id{/src/nvec\_par} 
\item configuration header file \id{sundials\_config.h} (see below)
\end{itemize}

A sample header file that, appropriately modified, can be used as
\id{sundials\_config.h} (otherwise created automatically by the
\id{configure} script) is provided below.

\lstset{language=C,frame=ltrb,framesep=5pt,basicstyle=\normalsize,

 */
#define SUNDIALS_MPI_COMM_F2C 1
\end{lstlisting}


The various preprocessor macros defined within \id{sundials\_config.h} have the following uses:
\begin{itemize}

\item Precision of the {\sundials} \id{realtype} type\\ \\
  Only one of the macros \id{SUNDIALS\_SINGLE\_PRECISION}, \id{SUNDIALS\_DOUBLE\_PRECISION} and \\
  \id{SUNDIALS\_EXTENDED\_PRECISION} should be defined to indicate if the {\sundials}
  \id{realtype} type is an alias for \id{float}, \id{double}, or \id{long double},
  respectively.

\item Use of generic math functions\\ \\
  If \id{SUNDIALS\_USE\_GENERIC\_MATH} is defined, then the functions
  in \id{sundials\_math.(h,c)} will use the \id{pow}, \id{sqrt},
  \id{fabs}, and \id{exp} functions from the standard math library
  (see \id{math.h}), regardless of the definition of \id{realtype}.
  Otherwise, if \id{realtype} is defined to be an alias for the
  \id{float} {\C}-type, then {\sundials} will use \id{powf},
  \id{sqrtf}, \id{fabsf}, and \id{expf}.  If \id{realtype} is instead
  defined to be a synonym for the \id{long double} {\C}-type, then
  \id{powl}, \id{sqrtl}, \id{fabsl}, and \id{expl} will be used.

  {\em Note}: Although the \id{powf}/\id{powl}, \id{sqrtf}/\id{sqrtl},
  \id{fabsf}/\id{fabsl}, and \id{expf}/\id{expl} routines are not
  specified in the ANSI {\C} standard, they are ISO C99 requirements.
  Consequently, these routines will only be used if available.

\item {\F} name-mangling scheme\\ \\
  The macros given below are used to transform the {\C}-language
  function names defined in the {\F}-{\C} inteface modules in a manner
  consistent with the preferred {\F} compiler, thus allowing native
  {\C} functions to be called from within a {\F} subroutine. The
  name-mangling scheme is specified by appropriately
  defining the parameterized macros (using the stringization operator,
  \id{\#\#}, if necessary)
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \id{F77\_FUNC(name,NAME)}
  \item \id{F77\_FUNC\_(name,NAME)}
  \end{itemize}

  For example, to specify that mangled {\C}-language function names
  should be lowercase with one underscore appended include
\begin{verbatim}
  #define F77_FUNC(name,NAME) name ## _
  #define F77_FUNC_(name,NAME) name ## _
\end{verbatim}
  in the \id{sundials\_config.h} header file.

\item Use of an {\mpi} communicator other than \id{MPI\_COMM\_WORLD} in {\F}\\ \\
  If the macro \id{SUNDIALS\_MPI\_COMM\_F2C} is defined, then the
  {\mpi} implementation used to build {\sundials} defines the type
  \id{MPI\_Fint} and the function \id{MPI\_Comm\_f2c}, and it is
  possible to use {\mpi} communicators other than
  \id{MPI\_COMM\_WORLD} with the {\F}-{\C} interface modules.
\end{itemize}






















%%===============================================================================
\section{CMake-based installation}
%%===============================================================================



Using CMake as a build system for the {\sundials} libraries has the advantage that GUI
based build configuration is possible. Also build files for Windows development environments 
can be easily generated. On the Windows platform compilers such as the Borland C++ compiler 
or Visual C++ compiler are natively supported. 

The installation options are very similar to the options mentioned above. Note, however, 
that CMake may not support all features and plattforms that are supported by the autotools build system.

\subsection{Prerequisites}
You may need to get CMake if it isn't available on your system already. In order to use the CMake build system,
you need a fairly recent CMake version. You can download it from \id{http://www.cmake.org www.cmake.org}. 
If you are building cmake from sources on Linux/Unix, make sure to have curses (including development libraries)
installed, so that ccmake gets compiled as well. Build instructions for cmake (only necessary for *nix systems) 
can be found on the CMake page. Once you have CMake installed, you should be able to use \id{CMakeSetup.exe} 
on Windows and \id{ccmake} on Linux/Unix. 

\subsection{Building on Linux/Unix}

We assume that the {\sundials} sources have been uncompressed in {\em srcdir}. Next, create the {\em builddir}, for example
inside {\em srcdir} (you can also create the build directory anywhere else, simply substitute the \id{..} in the next command
with the path to {\em srcdir}). Next change into that directory and run \id{ccmake}.
\begin{verbatim}
   % mkdir build
   % cd build
   % ccmake ..
\end{verbatim}
You should now see the ccmake curses interface. Press 'c' to configure your build with the default
options. You should see an option listing like in the following screenshot.
[[<image ccmake1.png size="medium"]]
(If you don't have curses on your system and cannot use ccmake, you can configure cmake with
command line options very similar to ./configure of the autotools. You can read about this on
the cmake webpage.)

In the dialog you can adjust the build options. For details see the options above
in the autotools section. To adjust advanced options press 't' to show all the options
and settings CMake offers. 

After adjusting some options, for instance enabling the examples by turning 
\id{ENABLE\_EXAMPLES} to \id{ON}, you need to press 'c' again. Depending on the options, 
you will see new options at the top of the list, marked with a star. After adjusting the 
new options, press 'c' again. Once all options have been set, you can press 'g' to generate 
the make files.

Now you can build and install the sundials library:
\begin{verbatim}
   % make
   % make install
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Building on Windows}

The first part in this section is a step-by-step compilation and usage guide for Visual Studio 
users (namely Visual Studio 2005 aka VC8). In the second part we describe how to build 
{\sundials} using Mingw32 GCC or other compilers, which is very similar to the method used 
on Linux/Unix system. 

The first common part is the extraction of the archives, which, due to a lack of native 
support of \id{tag.gz} files, is not quite as trivial as on Linux. 

\subsubsection*{Extracting the archives}

Begin by placing the {\sundials} tarball in one directory on your harddrive, for instance 
C:$\backslash$sundials.


If you simply double-click the files, chances are that you will get the helpful 
"unknown file type" window. It is futile searching for a program on a standard install, 
\id{tar.gz} files are not supported natively on Windows. Instead, download one of 
the many zip utilities (e.g. the open source tool \id{7-zip} available from
\id{http://www.7-zip.org/}, which will be used below.)

Use the "Extract here" option to uncompress the \id{sundials-x.y.z.tar.gz} archive.
Use the "Extract here" option again on the \id{sundials-x.y.z.tar} file and all 
the files will be extracted into a new \id{sundials-x.y.z} subdirectory (the {\em srcdir}).

\subsubsection*{Building and using Sundials with Visual Studio}

\noindent{\bf Configuration of the {\sundials} build.}
Now you need to open a console window. 
Note that, in order for the correct path variables to be set, you need to open the command 
line via the link provided as Visual Studio start menu option.

Inside that command window change into the source directory and run \id{CMakeSetup.exe}. 
In case \id{CMakeSetup.exe} does not start the CMake configuration utility, 
check that the CMake bin directory is in your path environment variable.

Now you should see the CMake configuration dialog. First select the {\em srcdir} \id{sundials-x.y.z}
as the source directory. Then copy this directory over in the "build" directory 
{\bf and} append the directory name 'build'.

Now you can start the configuration process by clicking on 'configure'. 
You will be prompted with a number of make file generator options.
Select 'Visual Studio 8 2005" (or select a different make file generator, 
if you work with a different version). The \id{CMakeSetup.exe} tool will now verify 
the build tool chain and determine the compilation options. 
Once completed, you will see a list of build options to select. 
(If the build chain detection fails, there is probably some problem with the 
VC8 installation or some missing/wrong environmental variables).

You can now adjust the listed options to your needs. Once you are finished, 
simply click 'configure' again. All options, that are fully configured will turn grey, 
indicating that you are ready to generate the makefiles. For instance, you can turn 
compilation of the examples on.

Finally press 'OK' to generate the VC project files. The content of the build directory 
will now show the following files:


{\bf MORE HERE...}



\noindent{\bf Building the library (and examples).}
Now simply double click on the \id{ALL\_BUILD.vcproj} project file and Visual Studio 
will open with a (long) list of generated projects.

Simply build the whole solution and after a while the build log will confirm that 
everything went all right.

Having the libraries compiled, now it is fairly easy to use them in your own projects.

\noindent{\bf Using the Sundials library.}
Three tasks are involved in order to use a solver of the Sundials library in your own code:
\begin{itemize}
\item set include directories in your project
\item add required {\sundials} library project files to your solution
\item set the {\sundials} libraries as Dependencies
\end{itemize}

Here's a small step-by-step example which illustrates the process of building 
a {\cvode} based application using one of the included examples. 

\begin{itemize}

\item First close the current solution and create a new Win32 console project. 
In the "New project" wizard set the following Application options to create an empty project.

\item We need the {\cvode} and {\nvecs} libraries. 
Use the "Add->Existing project..." option from the solution context menu and select 
the project files
\begin{verbatim}
C:\Sundials\sundials-2.5.0\build\src\cvode\sundials_cvode_static.vcproj
\end{verbatim}
and
\begin{verbatim}
C:\Sundials\sundials-2.3.0\build\src\nvec_ser\sundials_nvecserial_static.vcproj
\end{verbatim}

\item Also add the example program 
\begin{verbatim}
C:\Sundials\sundials-2.3.0\examples\cvode\serial\cvbanx.c
\end{verbatim}
to your empty console project. 

\item Now we still need to adjust some of our project settings, because compilation of 
the example project still fails because the Sundials headers cannot be found. 
Open the project properties and go to the C++ options.

\item Here you need to select the include directory in the {\sundials} source directory 
{\bf and} the include directory in the {\sundials} build directory.

\item Now also verify that the linker options show that "Link Library Dependencies" is enabled.

\item Last but not least set the project dependencies. Open "Project Dependencies" from the context 
menu of your example project, and check both {\sundials} libraries.

\item Finally, compile your project and run it.

\end{itemize}


\subsubsection*{Building Sundials with Mingw32-GCC or other compilers}

This requires a console window with a correctly set path variable for \id{mingw}.

First create a subdirectory 'build' inside the sundials source directory 
(you can also create the build directory anywhere else). Next run \id{CMakeSetup.exe} with 
the \id{sundials} source directory as command line argument. 
Alternatively, simply run \id{CMakeSetup.exe} and select the source and build directories 
from the directory combo boxes.

When pressing 'configure' for the first time you will be prompted with a choice of build systems.
Select the compiler/build system you want to use and press 'OK'. 

In the dialog you can now adjust the build options. For details see the options above in the
autotools section. Check the "Show advanced values" checkbox if you want to set advanced options. 

After adjusting all options press configure again (all lines should become grey) and OK to
generate make files and quit the GUI.

Now you can run your build systems make tool, e.g. mingw32-make for mingw, make for Borland C++.
To use the Intel Compiler you need to create nmake build files and you must start the console
window from the provided start menu entry.

\section{Installed libraries and exported header files}

%%===============================================================================

Using the standard {\sundials} build system, the command
\begin{verbatim}
   % make install
\end{verbatim}
will install the libraries under {\em libdir} and the public header
files under {\em includedir}. The default values for these directories are
{\em instdir}\id{/lib} and {\em instdir}\id{/include},
respectively, but can be changed using the configure script options
\id{--prefix}, \id{--exec-prefix}, \id{--includedir} and \id{--libdir} (see
\S\ref{ss:configuration_options}). For example, a global installation
of {\sundials} on a {\sc *NIX} system could be accomplished using
\begin{verbatim}
   % configure --prefix=/opt/sundials-2.1.1
\end{verbatim}
Although all installed libraries reside under {\em libdir}, the public header files
are further organized into subdirectories under {\em includedir}.

The installed libraries and exported header files are listed for
reference in Table~\ref{t:sundials_files}.  The file extension .{\em lib}
is typically \id{.so} for shared libraries and \id{.a} for static libraries
(see {\em Options for library support} for additional details).
Note that, in Table~\ref{t:sundials_files}, names are relative to {\em libdir}
for libraries and to {\em includedir} for header files.

A typical user program need not explicitly include any of the shared
{\sundials} header files from under the {\em includedir}\id{/sundials}
directory since they are explicitly included by the appropriate solver
header files ({\em e.g.}, \id{cvode\_dense.h} includes
\id{sundials\_dense.h}). However, it is both legal and safe to do so
({\em e.g.}, the functions declared in \id{sundials\_smalldense.h} 
could be used in building a preconditioner).
