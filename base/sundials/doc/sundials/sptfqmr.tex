The {\sptfqmr} package, in the files \id{sundials\_sptfqmr.h} and \id{sundials\_sptfqmr.c}, includes an
implementation of the scaled preconditioned TFQMR\index{TFQMR method} method.  
For full details, including usage instructions, see the file \id{sundials\_sptfqmr.h}.
\index{SPTFQMR@{\sptfqmr} generic linear solver!description of|)}

{\warn}The {\sptfqmr} package can only be used in conjunction with an actual {\nvector} 
implementation library, such as the {\nvecs} or {\nvecp} provided with {\sundials}.

The files needed to use the {\sptfqmr} module by itself are the same as for the
{\spgmr} module, with \id{sundials\_sptfqmr.(h,c)} replacing \id{sundials\_spgmr.(h,c)}.

\subsection{Functions}
\index{SPTFQMR@{\sptfqmr} generic linear solver!functions|(}
The following functions are available in the {\sptfqmr} package:  
\begin{itemize}
\item \id{SptfqmrMalloc}: allocation of memory for \id{SptfqmrSolve};
\item \id{SptfqmrSolve}: solution of $Ax = b$ by the {\sptfqmr} method;
\item \id{SptfqmrFree}: free memory allocated by \id{SptfqmrMalloc}.
\end{itemize}
