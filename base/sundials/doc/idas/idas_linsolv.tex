\chapter{Generic Linear Solvers in SUNDIALS}\label{s:gen_linsolv}
%===================================================================================
In this section, we describe five generic linear solver code modules that 
are included in {\idas}, but which are of potential use as generic packages in
themselves, either in conjunction with the use of {\idas} or separately.
These modules are:
\begin{itemize}
\item The {\dense} matrix package, which includes the matrix type \id{DenseMat},
      macros and functions for \id{DenseMat} matrices, and functions
      for small dense matrices treated as simple array types.
\item The {\band} matrix package, which includes the matrix type \id{BandMat},
      macros and functions for \id{BandMat} matrices.
\item The {\spgmr} package, which includes a solver for the scaled
      preconditioned GMRES method.
\item The {\spbcg} package, which includes a solver for the scaled
      preconditioned Bi-CGStab method.
\item The {\sptfqmr} package, which includes a solver for the scaled
      preconditioned TFQMR method.
\end{itemize}

For reasons related to installation, the names of the files involved
in these generic solvers begin with the prefix \id{sundials\_}.  But
despite this, each of the solvers is in fact generic, in that it is
usable completely independently of {\sundials}.

For the sake of space, the functions for \id{DenseMat} and
\id{BandMat} matrices and the functions in {\spgmr}, {\spbcg}, and {\sptfqmr}
are only summarized briefly, since they are less likely to be of direct use
in connection with {\idas}.  The functions for small dense matrices are fully
described, because we expect that they will be useful in the
implementation of preconditioners used with the combination of {\idas}
and the {\idaspgmr}, {\idaspbcg}, or {\idasptfqmr} solver.
