\chapter{Using CVODES for Adjoint Sensitivity Analysis}\label{s:adjoint}
%===================================================================================

This chapter describes the use of {\cvodes} to compute sensitivities of derived 
functions using adjoint sensitivity analysis. As mentioned before, the adjoint
sensitivity module of {\cvodes} provides the infrastructure for integrating
backward in time any system of ODEs that depends on the solution of the original
IVP, by providing various interfaces to the main {\cvodes} integrator, as well 
as several supporting user-callable functions. For this reason, in the following
sections we refer to the {\em backward problem} and not to the 
{\em adjoint problem} when discussing details relevant to the ODEs that
are integrated backward in  time. The backward problem can be the adjoint problem
(\ref{e:adj_eqns}) or (\ref{e:adj1_eqns}), and
can be augmented with some quadrature differential equations.

{\cvodes} uses various constants for both input and output.  These are
defined as needed in this chapter, but for convenience are also listed
separately in Chapter \ref{c:constants}.

We begin with a brief overview, in the form of a skeleton user program.
Following that are detailed descriptions of the interface to the
various user-callable functions and of the user-supplied functions that were not already
described in \S\ref{s:simulation}.

\section{A skeleton of the user's main program}
\label{ss:skeleton_adj}
%%---------------------------------------------------------------------
%%----------------------------------------------------------------------

The following is a skeleton of the user's main program as an application of
{\cvodes}. The user program is to have these steps in the order indicated, 
unless otherwise noted. For the sake of brevity, we defer many of the details to 
the later sections.
As in \S\ref{ss:skeleton_sim}, most steps are independent of the {\nvector}
implementation used; where this is not the case, usage specifications are given for the
two implementations provided with {\cvodes}: steps marked with {\p} correspond to 
{\nvecp}, while steps marked with {\s} correspond to {\nvecs}.

\index{User main program!Adjoint sensitivity analysis}
\begin{Steps}

\item
  {\bf Include necessary header files}
  
  The \id{cvodes.h} header file also defines additional types, constants, and
  function prototypes for the adjoint sensitivity module user-callable functions.
  In addition, the main program should include an {\nvector} 
  implementation header file (\id{nvector\_serial.h} or \id{nvector\_parallel.h}
  for the two implementations provided with {\cvodes}) and, if Newton iteration 
  was selected, the main header file of the desired linear solver module.

\item
  \textcolor{gray}{\bf {\p} Initialize MPI}

  \vspace{0.2in}\centerline{\bf Forward problem}

\item
  \textcolor{gray}{\bf Set problem dimensions for the forward problem}

\item
  \textcolor{gray}{\bf Set initial conditions for the forward problem}

\item
  \textcolor{gray}{\bf Create {\cvodes} object for the forward problem}

\item
  \textcolor{gray}{\bf Allocate internal memory for the forward problem}

\item
  \textcolor{gray}{\bf Set optional inputs for the forward problem}

\item
  \textcolor{gray}{\bf Attach linear solver module for the forward problem}

\item
  \textcolor{gray}{\bf Set linear solver optional inputs for the forward problem}

\item
  {\bf Allocate space for the adjoint computation}

  Call \id{cvadj\_mem = }\Id{CVadjMalloc}\id{()} to allocate memory for the 
  combined forward-backward problem (see \S\ref{sss:cvadjmalloc} for more details).
  This call requires \id{Nd}, the number of steps between two consecutive checkpoints.
  \Id{CVadjMalloc} also specifies the type of interpolation used 
  (see \S\ref{ss:checkpointing}).

\item
  {\bf Integrate forward problem}

  Call \Id{CVodeF}, a wrapper for the {\cvodes} main integration
  function \id{CVode}, either in \Id{CV\_NORMAL} mode to the time 
  \id{tout} or in \Id{CV\_ONE\_STEP} mode inside a loop (if intermediate
  solutions of the forward problem are desired (see \S\ref{sss:cvodef})).
  The final value of \id{tret}, denoted \id{tfinal}, is then
  the maximum allowable value for the endpoint $t_1$.

  \vspace{0.2in}\centerline{\bf Backward problem}

\item \label{i:back_start}
  {\bf Set problem dimensions for the backward problem}

  {\s} set \id{NB}, the number of variables in the backward problem \\
  {\p} set \id{NB} and \id{NBlocal}

\item
  {\bf Set final values for the backward problem}

  Set the vector \id{yB0} of final values for the backward problem.

\item
  {\bf Create {\cvodes} object for the backward problem}

  Call \Id{CVodeCreateB}, a wrapper for \id{CVodeCreate}, to
  create the {\cvodes} memory block and specify the solution method
  (linear multistep method and nonlinear solver iteration type) for
  the backward problem. Unlike \id{CVodeCreate}, the function \id{CVodeCreateB}
  does not return a pointer to the newly created memory block. Instead,
  this pointer is attached to the adjoint memory block (returned by
  \id{CVadjMalloc} and passed as the first argument to \id{CVodeCreateB}).

\item
  {\bf Allocate memory for the backward problem}

  Call \Id{CVodeMallocB}, a wrapper for \id{CVodeMalloc}, to 
  allocate internal memory and initialize {\cvodes} at \id{tB0} for 
  the backward problem (see \S\ref{sss:cvodemallocb}).

\item
  {\bf Set optional inputs for the backward problem}

  Call \id{CVodeSet*B} functions to change from their default values
  any optional inputs that control the behavior of {\cvodes}. Unlike
  their counterparts for the forward problem, these functions take as
  their first argument the adjoint memory block returned by \id{CVadjMalloc}.

\item \label{i:lin_solverB}
  {\bf Attach linear solver module for the backward problem}

  If Newton iteration is chosen, initialize the linear solver module 
  for the backward problem by calling the appropriate wrapper
  function: \id{CVDenseB}, \id{CVBandB}, \id{CVDiagB},
  \id{CVSpgmrB}, \id{CVSpbcgB}, or \id{CVSptfqmr} (see \S\ref{sss:lin_solv_b}). 
  Note that it is not required
  to use the same linear solver module for both the forward and the 
  backward problems; for example, the forward problem could be solved
  with the {\cvdense} linear solver and the backward problem with {\cvspgmr}.

\item \label{i:quadB}
  {\bf Initialize quadrature calculation}

  If additional quadrature equations must be evaluated, 
  call \id{CVodeQuadMallocB}, a wrapper around \id{CVodeQuadMalloc},
  to initialize and allocate memory for quadrature integration.
  Optionally, call \id{CVodeSetQuad*B} functions to change from their
  default values optional inputs that control the integration of
  quadratures during the backward phase.

\item
  {\bf Integrate backward problem}

  Call \Id{CVodeB}, a second wrapper around the {\cvodes} main integration
  function \id{CVode}, to integrate the backward problem from \id{tB0}
  (see \S\ref{sss:cvodeb}). This function can be called either in \id{CV\_NORMAL}
  or \id{CV\_ONE\_STEP} mode. Typically, \id{CVodeB} will be called in \id{CV\_NORMAL}
  mode with an end time equal to the initial time of the forward problem.

\item \label{i:back_end}
  {\bf Extract quadrature variables}

  If applicable, call \Id{CVodeGetQuadB}, a wrapper around \id{CVodeGetQuad},
  to extract the values of the quadrature variables at the time returned
  by the last call to \id{CVodeB}.

\item
  {\bf Deallocate memory}

  Upon completion of the backward integration, call all necessary deallocation
  functions. These include appropriate destructors for the vectors 
  \id{y} and \id{yB}, a call to \id{CVodeFree} to free the {\cvodes} memory block 
  for the forward problem, and a call to \id{CVadjFree} (see \S\ref{sss:cvadjmalloc}) to free 
  the memory allocated for the combined problem. 
  Note that \id{CVadjFree} also deallocates the {\cvodes} memory for the backward problem.

\item
  \textcolor{gray}{\bf Finalize MPI}

  {\p} If {\mpi} was initialized by the user main program, call \id{MPI\_Finalize();}.

\end{Steps}

The above user interface to the adjoint sensitivity module in {\cvodes} was motivated by
the desire to keep it as close as possible in look and feel to the one for ODE IVP 
integration. Note that if steps (\ref{i:back_start})-(\ref{i:back_end}) are not present, 
a program with the above structure will have the same functionality as one described in
\S\ref{ss:skeleton_sim} for integration of ODEs, albeit with some overhead due to 
the checkpointing scheme.

\subsection{Adjoint sensitivity allocation and deallocation functions}
\label{sss:cvadjmalloc}
%%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After the setup phase for the forward problem, but before the call
to \id{CVodeF}, memory for the combined forward-backward problem must be
allocated by a call to the function \id{CVadjMalloc}.
The form of the call to this function is
%%
%%
\ucfunction{CVadjMalloc}
{
  cvadj\_mem = CVadjMalloc(cvode\_mem, Nd, interpType);
}
{
  The function \ID{CVadjMalloc} allocates internal memory for the combined
  forward and backward integration, other than the {\cvodes} memory block. 
  Space is allocated for the $N_d$ interpolation data points and a linked 
  list of checkpoints is initialized.
}
{
  \begin{args}[interpType]
  \item[cvode\_mem] (\id{void *}) 
    is the {\cvodes} memory block for the forward problem
    returned by a previous call to \id{CVodeCreate}.
  \item[Nd] (\id{long int}) 
    is the number of integration steps between two consecutive checkpoints.
  \item[interpType] (\id{int})
    specifies the type of interpolation used and can be \Id{CV\_POLYNOMIAL}
    or \Id{CV\_HERMITE}, indicating variable-degree polynomial and cubic Hermite
    interpolation, respectively (see \S\ref{ss:checkpointing}).
  \end{args}
}
{
  If successful, \id{CVadjMalloc} returns a pointer of type \id{void *}. The user
  does not need to access this memory block but must pass it to other adjoint module
  user-callable functions. In case of failure (\id{cvode\_mem} is \id{NULL}, an input
  has an illegal value, or a memory request fails), \id{CVadjMalloc} prints an error
  message to the standard output stream \id{stderr} and returns \id{NULL}.
}
{
  The user must set \id{Nd} so that all data needed for interpolation of the 
  forward problem solution between two checkpoints fits in memory. \id{CVadjMalloc}
  attempts to allocate space for $(2$\id{Nd}$+3)$ variables of type \id{N\_Vector}.
}
%%
%%
\ucfunction{CVadjFree}
{
  CVadjFree(\&cvadj\_mem);
}
{
  The function \ID{CVadjFree} frees the memory allocated by
  a previous call to \id{CVadjMalloc}.
}
{
  The only argument is the address of the pointer to the adjoint memory 
  block (of type \id{void *}).
}
{
  The function \id{CVadjFree} has no return value.
}
{
  This function frees all memory allocated by \id{CVadjMalloc}. This includes workspace memory, 
  the linked list of checkpoints, memory for the interpolation data, as well as the {\cvodes} memory 
  for the backward integration phase.
}
%%
%%
If the user wishes to change the interpolation method after the call to \id{CVadjMalloc},
this can be done through a call to the function \id{CVadsSetInterpType}.
The form of the call to this function is
%%
\ucfunction{CVadjSetInterpType}
{
  flag = CVadjSetInterpType(cvadj\_mem, interpType);
}
{
  The function \ID{CVadjSetInterpType} resets the interpolation method to \id{interpType}.
}
{
  \begin{args}[interpType]
  \item[cvadj\_mem] (\id{void *})
    pointer to the adjoint memory block.
  \item[interpType] (\id{int})
    specifies the type of interpolation used and can be \Id{CV\_POLYNOMIAL}
    or \Id{CV\_HERMITE}, indicating variable-degree polynomial and cubic Hermite
    interpolation, respectively (see \S\ref{ss:checkpointing}).
  \end{args}
}
{
  The return \id{flag} (of type \id{int}) is one of:
  \begin{args}[CV\_ADJMEM\_NULL]
  \item[\Id{CV\_SUCCESS}]
    The call to \id{CVadjSetInterpType} was successful.
  \item[\Id{CV\_ADJMEM\_NULL}]
    The \id{cvadj\_mem} argument was \id{NULL}.
  \item[\Id{CV\_ILL\_INPUT}] 
    The input argument \id{interpType} has an illegal value.
  \item[\Id{CV\_MEM\_FAIL}]
    An error occured while trying to allocate memory for the interpolation module.
  \end{args}
}
{
  The function \id{CVadjSetInterpType} performs memory deallocation and allocation.
}


%%---------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Forward integration function}
\label{sss:cvodef}
%%---------------------------------------------------------------------

The function \ID{CVodeF} is very similar to the {\cvodes} function \id{CVode}
(see \S\ref{sss:cvode}) in that it integrates the solution of the forward
problem and returns the solution in \id{y}. At the same time,
however, \id{CVodeF} stores checkpoint data every \id{Nd} integration steps.
\id{CVodeF} can be called repeatedly by the user.
%%
The call to this function has the form
%%
\ucfunction{CVodeF}
{
  flag = CVodeF(cvadj\_mem, tout, yout, tret, itask, ncheck);
}
{
  The function \ID{CVodeF} integrates the forward problem over an interval in $t$
  and saves checkpointing data.
}
{
  \begin{args}[cvadj\_mem]
  \item[cvadj\_mem] (\id{void *})
    pointer to the adjoint memory block.
  \item[tout] (\id{realtype})
    the next time at which a computed solution is desired.
  \item[yout] (\id{N\_Vector})
    the computed solution vector.
  \item[tret] (\id{realtype *})
    the time reached by the solver.
  \item[itask] (\id{int})
    \index{itask@\texttt{itask}}
    \index{output mode}
    a flag indicating the job of the solver for the next step. 
    The \Id{CV\_NORMAL} task is to have the solver take internal steps until   
    it has reached or just passed the user-specified \id{tout}
    parameter. The solver then interpolates in order to   
    return an approximate value of $y($\id{tout}$)$. 
    The \Id{CV\_ONE\_STEP} option tells the solver to just take one internal step  
    and return the solution at the point reached by that step. 
    The \Id{CV\_NORMAL\_TSTOP} and \Id{CV\_ONE\_STEP\_TSTOP} modes are     
    similar to \id{CV\_NORMAL} and \id{CV\_ONE\_STEP}, respectively, except    
    that the integration never proceeds past the value      
    \id{tstop} (specified through the function \id{CVodeSetStopTime}).
  \end{args}
}
{
  On return, \id{CVodeF} returns a vector \id{yout} and a corresponding 
  independent variable value $t=$\id{*tret}, such that \id{yout} is the computed 
  value of $y(t)$. Additionally, it returns in \id{ncheck} the number of
  checkpoints saved.
  The return value \id{flag} (of type \id{int}) will be one of the following.
  For more details see \S\ref{sss:cvode}.
  \begin{args}[CV\_TOO\_MUCH\_WORK]
  \item[\Id{CV\_SUCCESS}]
    \id{CVodeF} succeeded.
  \item[\Id{CV\_TSTOP\_RETURN}]
    \id{CVodeF} succeeded by reaching the optional stopping point.
  \item[\Id{CV\_NO\_MALLOC}]
    The function \id{CVodeMalloc} has not been previously called.
  \item[\Id{CV\_ILL\_IPUT}]
    One of the inputs to \id{CVodeF} is illegal.
  \item[\Id{CV\_TOO\_MUCH\_WORK}] 
    The solver took \id{mxstep} internal steps but could not reach tout. 
  \item[\Id{CV\_TOO\_MUCH\_ACC}] 
    The solver could not satisfy the accuracy demanded by the user for some 
    internal step.
  \item[\Id{CV\_ERR\_FAILURE}]
    Error test failures occurred too many times during one 
    internal time step or occurred with $|h| = h_{min}$.
  \item[\Id{CV\_CONV\_FAILURE}] 
    Convergence test failures occurred too many times during 
    one internal time step or occurred with $|h| = h_{min}$.             
  \item[\Id{CV\_LSETUP\_FAIL}] 
    The linear solver's setup function failed in an unrecoverable manner.
  \item[\Id{CV\_LSOLVE\_FAIL}] 
    The linear solver's solve function failed in an unrecoverable manner.
  \item[\Id{CV\_ADJMEM\_NULL}]
    The \id{cvadj\_mem} argument was \id{NULL}.
  \item[\Id{CV\_MEM\_FAIL}]
    A memory allocation request has failed (in an attempt to allocate space
    for a new checkpoint).
  \end{args} 
}
{
  All failure return values are negative and therefore a test \id{flag}$< 0$
  will trap all \id{CVodeF} failures.

  At this time, \id{CVodeF} stores checkpoint information in memory
  only. Future versions will provide for a safeguard option of dumping checkpoint
  data into a temporary file as needed. The data stored at each checkpoint is basically
  a snapshot of the {\cvodes} internal memory block and contains enough information
  to restart the integration from that time and to proceed with the same step size and
  method order sequence as during the forward integration.
  
  In addition, \id{CVodeF} also stores interpolation data between consecutive checkpoints
  so that, at the end of this first forward integration phase, interpolation information
  is already available from the last checkpoint forward. In particular,
  if no check points were necessary, there is no need for the second forward integration phase.

  {\warn}Although it is legal to define a value for \id{tstop} and then call \id{CVodeF}
  in \id{CV\_NORMAL\_TSTOP} or \id{CV\_ONE\_STEP\_TSTOP} modes, 
  after a return with \id{flag} $=$ \id{TSTOP\_RETURN}, the integration should not be 
  continued (no \id{tstop} information is stored at checkpoints).

  {\warn}It is illegal to change the integration tolerances between consecutive calls
  to \id{CVodeF}, as this information is not captured in the checkpoints data.
}

\subsection{Backward problem initialization functions}
\label{sss:cvodemallocb}
%%---------------------------------------------------------------------

The functions \id{CVodeCreateB} and \id{CVodeMallocB} must be called in the order listed. 
They instantiate a {\cvodes} solver object, provide problem and solution specifications, 
and allocate internal memory for the backward problem.
%%
%%
\ucfunction{CVodeCreateB}
{
  flag = CVodeCreateB(cvadj\_mem, lmm, iter);
}
{
  The function \ID{CVodeCreateB} instantiates a {\cvodes} solver object and specifies 
  the solution method for the backward problem.

  \begin{args}[cvadj\_mem]
  \item[cvadj\_mem] (\id{void *})
    pointer to the adjoint memory block returned by \id{CVadjMalloc}.

    possible values: \Id{CV\_ADAMS} or \Id{CV\_BDF}.     
  \item[iter] (\id{int})
    specifies the type of nonlinear solver iteration and must be
    either \Id{CV\_NEWTON} or \Id{CV\_FUNCTIONAL}. 
  \end{args}
}
{
  If successful, \id{CVodeCreateB} stores a pointer to the newly created 
  {\cvodes} memory block (of type \id{void *}) for the backward problem.

    The call to \id{CVodeCreateB} was successful.

The function \id{CVodeMallocB} is essentially a call to \id{CVodeMalloc} with some 
particularization for backward integration as described below.
\ucfunction{CVodeMallocB}
{
  flag = CVodeMallocB(cvadj\_mem, fB, tB0, yB0, itolB, reltolB, abstolB);

  allocates internal memory, and initializes {\cvodes} for the backward problem.

  \begin{args}[cvadj\_mem]
  \item[cvadj\_mem] (\id{void *})
    pointer to the adjoint memory block returned by \id{CVadjMalloc}.

    backward ODE problem. This function has the form 
    \id{fB(t, y, yB, yBdot, f\_dataB)} (for full details see \S\ref{ss:user_fct_adj}).
  \item[tB0] (\id{realtype})
    specifies the endpoint where final conditions are provided for the 
    backward problem.

    \index{tolerances}
    is the relative error tolerance.
  \item[abstolB] (\id{void *})

%%
%%
For the case when it is needed to solve several different backward problems 
corresponding to the same original problem, {\cvodes} provides a mechanism 
to reuse the existing checkpoints. The function \ID{CVodeReInitB} reinitializes
the {\cvodes} memory block for the backward problem, where a prior call to
\Id{CVodeMallocB} has been made with the same problem size \id{NB}.
\id{CVodeReInitB} performs the same input checking and initializations that 
\id{CVodeMallocB} does, but does no memory allocation, 
assuming that the existing internal memory is sufficient for the new problem.

\subsection{Linear solver initialization functions for backward problem}
\label{sss:lin_solv_b}
%%---------------------------------------------------------------------

\index{CVODES@{\cvodes} linear solvers!usage with adjoint module|(} 
All linear solver modules in {\cvodes} provide additional specification functions 
for the case in which Newton iteration is selected for the solution of the backward problem. 
The initialization functions described in \S\ref{sss:lin_solv_init} cannot be directly used 
since the optional user-defined Jacobian-related functions have different prototypes for the
backward problem than for the forward problem (see \S\ref{ss:user_fct_adj}).
\index{CVODES@{\cvodes} linear solvers!usage with adjoint module|)} 

The following six wrapper functions can be used to initialize one of the linear
solver modules for the backward problem. Their arguments are identical to those
of the functions in \S\ref{sss:lin_solv_init} with the exception of their first
argument which must be the pointer to the adjoint memory block returned by
\id{CVadjMalloc}.
\begin{verbatim}
  flag = CVDenseB(cvadj_mem, nB);
  flag = CVDiagB(cvadj_mem);
  flag = CVBandB(cvadj_mem, nB, mupperB, mlowerB);
  flag = CVSpgmrB(cvadj_mem, pretypeB, maxlB);
  flag = CVSpbcgB(cvadj_mem, pretypeB, maxlB);
  flag = CVSptfqmrB(cvadj_mem, pretypeB, maxlB);
  flag = CVSpbcgB(cvadj_mem, pretypeB, maxlB);
  flag = CVSptfqmrB(cvadj_mem, pretypeB, maxlB);
\end{verbatim}
Their return value \id{flag} (of type \id{int}) can have any of the return values 
of their counterparts.
If the \id{cvadj\_mem} argument was \id{NULL}, \id{flag} will be
\id{CVDENSE\_ADJMEM\_NULL}, \id{CVDIAG\_ADJMEM\_NULL}, 
\id{CVBAND\_ADJMEM\_NULL}, or \id{CVSPILS\_ADJMEM\_NULL}.

%%---------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Backward integration function}
\label{sss:cvodeb}
%%---------------------------------------------------------------------

The function \ID{CVodeB} performs the integration of the backward problem.
It is essentially a wrapper for the {\cvodes} main integration function 
\id{CVode} and, in the case in which checkpoints were needed, it evolves 
the solution of the backward problem through a sequence of forward-backward 
integrations between consecutive checkpoints. 
The first run integrates the original IVP forward in time and
stores interpolation data; the second run integrates the backward problem 
backward in time and performs the required interpolation to provide
the solution of the IVP to the backward problem.

The call to this function has the form
%%
%%
\ucfunction{CVodeB}
{
  flag = CVodeB(cvadj\_mem, tBout, yBout, tBret, itaskB);
}
{
  The function \ID{CVodeB} integrates the backward ODE problem over an 
  interval in $t$.
}
{
  \begin{args}[cvadj\_mem]
  \item[cvadj\_mem] (\id{void *})
    pointer to the adjoint memory block returned by \id{CVadjMalloc}.
  \item[tBout] (\id{realtype})
    the next time at which a computed solution is desired.
  \item[yBout] (\id{N\_Vector})
    the computed solution vector of the backward problem.
  \item[tBret] (\id{realtype *})
    the time reached by the solver.
  \item[itaskB] (\id{int})
    \index{output mode}
    a flag indicating the job of the solver for the next step. 
    The \Id{CV\_NORMAL} task is to have the solver take internal steps until   
    it has reached or just passed the user specified \id{tBout}
    parameter. The solver then interpolates in order to   
    return an approximate value of $yB($\id{tBout}$)$. 
    The \Id{CV\_ONE\_STEP} option tells the solver to just take one internal step  
    and return the solution at the point reached by that step. 
  \end{args}
}
{
  On return, \id{CVodeB} returns a vector \id{yBout} and a corresponding 
  independent variable value $t=$\id{*tBret}, such that \id{yBout} is the computed 
  value of the solution of the backward problem.

  The return value \id{flag} (of type \id{int}) will be one of the following.
  For more details see \S\ref{sss:cvode}.
  \begin{args}[CV\_TOO\_MUCH\_WORK]
  \item[\Id{CV\_SUCCESS}]
    \id{CVodeB} succeeded.
  \item[\Id{CV\_NO\_MALLOC}]
    The {\cvodes} memory for the backward problem was \id{NULL}.
  \item[\Id{CV\_ILL\_INPUT}]
    One of the inputs to \id{CVode} is illegal.
  \item[\Id{CV\_BAD\_ITASK}]
    The \id{itaskB} argument has an illegal value.
  \item[\Id{CV\_TOO\_MUCH\_WORK}] 
    The solver took \id{mxstep} internal steps but could not reach \id{tBout}. 
  \item[\Id{CV\_TOO\_MUCH\_ACC}] 
    The solver could not satisfy the accuracy demanded by the user for some 
    internal step.
  \item[\Id{CV\_ERR\_FAILURE}]
    Error test failures occurred too many times during one internal time step.
  \item[\Id{CV\_CONV\_FAILURE}] 
    Convergence test failures occurred too many times during one internal time step.
  \item[\Id{CV\_LSETUP\_FAIL}] 
    The linear solver's setup function failed in an unrecoverable manner.
  \item[\Id{CV\_SOLVE\_FAIL}] 
    The linear solver's solve function failed in an unrecoverable manner.
  \item[\Id{CV\_ADJMEM\_NULL}]
    The \id{cvadj\_mem} argument was \id{NULL}.
  \item[\Id{CV\_BCKMEM\_NULL}]
    The \id{cvodes} memory for the backward problem was not created through
    a call to \id{CVodeCreateB}.
  \item[\Id{CV\_BAD\_TBOUT}]
    The desired output time \id{tBout} is outside the interval over which the 
    forward problem was solved.
  \item[\Id{CV\_REIFWD\_FAIL}]
    Reinitialization of the forward problem failed at the first checkpoint
    (corresponding to the initial time of the forward problem).
  \item[\Id{CV\_FWD\_FAIL}]
    An error occured during the integration of the forward problem.
  \end{args} 
}
{
  All failure return values are negative and therefore a test \id{flag}$< 0$
  will trap all \id{CVodeB} failures.

input functions defined in \S\ref{sss:optin_main}. The only difference is

  \item[\Id{CV\_SUCCESS}]
    The call to \id{CVodeReInitB} was successful.
  \item[\Id{CV\_MEM\_NULL}] 
    The {\cvodes} solver memory block was not created through a

\subsubsection{Backward quadrature extraction function}

To extract the values of the quadrature variables at the last return time
of \id{CVodeB}, {\cvodes} provides a wrapper for the function \ID{CVodeGetQuad}
(see \S\ref{ss:quad_get}). The call to this function has the form
%%
%%
\ucfunction{CVodeGetQuadB}
{
  flag = CVodeGetQuadB(cvadj\_mem, yQB);
}
{
  The function \id{CVodeGetQuadB} returns the quadrature solution vector after
  a successful return from \id{CVodeB}.
}
{
  \begin{args}[cvadj\_mem]
  \item[cvadj\_mem] (\id{void *})
    pointer to the adjoint memory returned by \id{CVadjMalloc}.
  \item[yQB] (\id{N\_Vector})
    the computed backward quadrature vector.
  \end{args}
}

  The return value \id{flag} of \id{CVodeGetQuadB} is one of:
  \begin{args}[CV\_ADJMEM\_NULL]
  \item[\Id{CV\_SUCCESS}] 
    \id{CVodeGetQuadB} was successful.
  \item[\Id{CV\_MEM\_NULL}] 
    The {\cvodes} solver memory block was not created through a

  \item[\Id{Cv\_BAD\_DKY}] 
    \id{yQB} is \id{NULL}.
  \item[\Id{CV\_ADJMEM\_NULL}]
    The \id{cvadj\_mem} argument was \id{NULL}.
  \end{args}
}
{}

\subsubsection{Optional input/output functions for backward quadrature integration}
\index{optional input!quadrature integration}
\index{optional output!quadrature integration}
Optional values controlling the backward integration of quadrature equations can be changed
from their default values through calls to one of the following functions which are wrappers for
the corresponding optional input functions defined in \S\ref{ss:quad_optional_input}:
\begin{verbatim}
  flag = CVodeSetQuadFdataB(cvadj_mem, fQ_dataB);
  flag = CVodeSetQuadErrConB(cvadj_mem, errconQB, itolQB, reltolQB, abstolQB);
\end{verbatim}
Their return value \id{flag} (of type \id{int}) can have any of the return values 
of their counterparts, but it can also be \Id{CV\_ADJMEM\_NULL} if the \id{cvadj\_mem} 
argument was \id{NULL}. 

Access to optional outputs related to backward quadrature integration can be obtained
by calling the corresponding \id{CVodeGetQuad*} functions 
(see \S\ref{ss:quad_optional_output}). 
A pointer to the {\cvodes} memory block for the backward problem, required as the first 
argument of these functions, can be obtained through a call to the functions 
\id{CVadjGetCVodeBmem} (see \S\ref{ss:optional_output_B}).

\section{User-supplied functions for adjoint sensitivity analysis}
\label{ss:user_fct_adj}
%%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
%%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
%%

In addition to the required ODE right-hand side function and any optional functions
for the forward problem, when using the adjoint sensitivity module in {\cvodes},
the user must supply one function defining the backward problem ODE and, optionally,
functions to supply Jacobian-related information (if Newton iteration is chosen) and
one or two functions that define the preconditioner (if one of the {\cvspils} solvers is
selected) for the backward problem.
Type definitions for all these user-supplied functions are given below.

\subsection{ODE right-hand side for the backward problem}
\index{adjoint sensitivity analysis!right-hand side evaluation}
\index{right-hand side function!backward problem}

The user must provide a function of type \ID{CVRhsFnB} defined as follows:
\usfunction{CVRhsFnB}
{
  typedef int (*CVRhsFnB)(&realtype t, N\_Vector y, N\_Vector yB, \\
                          &N\_Vector yBdot, void *f\_dataB);
}
{
  This function computes the right-hand side of the backward problem ODE system.
  This could be (\ref{e:adj_eqns}) or (\ref{e:adj1_eqns}).
}
{
  \begin{args}[f\_dataB]
  \item[t]
    is the current value of the independent variable.
  \item[y]
    is the current value of the forward solution vector.
  \item[yB]
    is the current value of the dependent variable vector.
  \item[yBdot]
    is the output vector containing the right-hand side of the backward ODE problem.
  \item[f\_dataB]
    is a pointer to user data - the same as the \Id{f\_dataB}      
    parameter passed to \id{CVodeSetFdataB}.   
  \end{args}
}
{
  A \id{CVRhsFnB} should return 0 if successful, a positive value if a recoverable
  error occurred (in which case {\cvodes} will attempt to correct), or a negative 
  value if it failed unrecoverably (in which case the integration is halted and
  \id{CVodeB} returns \Id{CV\_RHSFUNC\_FAIL}).
}
{
  Allocation of memory for \id{yBdot} is handled within {\cvodes}.

  The \id{y}, \id{yB}, and \id{yBdot} arguments are all of type \id{N\_Vector},
  but \id{yB} and \id{yBdot}  typically have different internal representations
  from \id{y}. It is the user's 
  responsibility to access the vector data consistently (including the use of the 
  correct accessor macros from each {\nvector} implementation). For the sake of 
  computational efficiency, the vector functions in the two {\nvector} implementations 
  provided with {\cvodes} do not perform any consistency checks with respect to their 
  \id{N\_Vector} arguments (see \S\ref{ss:nvec_ser} and \S\ref{ss:nvec_par}).

  The \id{f\_dataB} pointer is passed to 
  the user's \id{fB} function every time it is called and can be the same as the 
  \id{f\_data} pointer used for the forward problem.

  {\warn}Before calling the user's \id{CVRhsFnB}, {\cvodea} needs to evaluate
  (through interpolation) the values of the states from the forward integration. 
  If an error occurrs in the interpolation, {\cvodea} triggers an unrecoverable
  failure in the righ-hand side function which will halt the integration and
  \id{CVodeB} will return \id{CV\_RHSFUNC\_FAIL}.
}

%%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Quadrature right-hand side for the backward problem}
\index{right-hand side function!quadrature backward problem}
\index{adjoint sensitivity analysis!quadrature evaluation}
The user must provide a function of type \ID{CVQuadRhsFnB} defined by
\usfunction{CVQuadRhsFnB}
{
  typedef int (*CVQuadRhsFnB)(&realtype t, N\_Vector y, N\_Vector yB, \\
                              &N\_Vector qBdot, void *fQ\_dataB);
}
{
  This function computes the quadrature equation right-hand side for the
  backward problem.
}
{
  \begin{args}[fQ\_dataB]
  \item[t]
    is the current value of the independent variable.
  \item[y]
    is the current value of the forward solution vector.
  \item[yB]
    is the current value of the dependent variable vector.
  \item[qBdot]
    is the output vector containing the right-hand side of the backward quadrature
    equations.
  \item[fQ\_dataB]
    is a pointer to user data - the same as the \Id{fQ\_dataB}      
    parameter passed to \id{CVodeSetQuadFdataB}.   
  \end{args}
}
{
  A \id{CVQuadRhsFnB} should return 0 if successful, a positive value if a recoverable
  error occurred (in which case {\cvodes} will attempt to correct), or a negative 
  value if it failed unrecoverably (in which case the integration is halted and
  \id{CVodeB} returns \Id{CV\_QRHSFUNC\_FAIL}).
}
{
  Allocation of memory for \id{qBdot} is handled within {\cvodes}.

  The \id{y}, \id{yB}, and \id{yQBdot} arguments are all of type \id{N\_Vector},
  but they  typically all have different internal representations. It is the user's 
  responsibility to access the vector data consistently (including the use of the 
  correct accessor macros from each {\nvector} implementation). For the sake of 
  computational efficiency, the vector functions in the two {\nvector} implementations 
  provided with {\cvodes} do not perform any consistency checks with repsect to their 
  \id{N\_Vector} arguments (see \S\ref{ss:nvec_ser} and \S\ref{ss:nvec_par}).

  The \id{fQ\_dataB} pointer is passed to the user's \id{fQB} function every time 
  it is called and can be the same as the \id{f\_data} pointer used for the forward problem.

  {\warn}Before calling the user's \id{CVQuadRhsFnB}, {\cvodea} needs to evaluate
  (through interpolation) the values of the states from the forward integration. 
  If an error occurrs in the interpolation, {\cvodea} triggers an unrecoverable
  failure in the quadrature righ-hand side function which will halt the integration and
  \id{CVodeB} will return \id{CV\_QRHSFUNC\_FAIL}.

\subsection{Jacobian information for the backward problem 
  (direct method with dense Jacobian)}
  
If the direct linear solver with dense treatment of the Jacobian is selected
for the backward problem (i.e. \Id{CVDenseB} is called in step \ref{i:lin_solverB} 
of \S\ref{ss:skeleton_adj}), the user may provide, through a call to \id{CVDenseSetJacFnB}
(see \S\ref{ss:optional_input_B}), a function of the following type:
%%
\index{Jacobian approximation function!dense!user-supplied (backward)}

{
  typedef int (*CVDenseJacFnB)(&long int nB, DenseMat JB, realtype t, \\

                               &N\_Vector tmp2B, N\_Vector tmp3B);
}
{
  This function computes the dense Jacobian of the backward problem (or an approximation
  to it). If the backward problem is the adjoint of the original IVP, then
  this Jacobian is just the transpose of $J = \dfdyI$ with
  a change in sign.
}
{
  \begin{args}[jac\_dataB]
  \item[nB]
    is the backward problem size.

  \item[tmp2B]
  \item[tmp3B]

    for variables of type \id{N\_Vector} which can be used by           
    \id{CVDenseJacFnB} as temporary storage or work space.    
  \end{args}
}
{
  A \id{CVDenseJacFnB} should return 0 if successful, a positive value if a recoverable
  error occurred (in which case {\cvodes} will attempt to correct, while {\cvdense} sets
  \id{last\_flag} on \Id{CVDENSE\_JACFUNC\_RECVR}), or a negative 
  value if it failed unrecoverably (in which case the integration is halted, \id{CVodeB}
  returns \Id{CV\_LSETUP\_FAIL} and {\cvdense} sets \id{last\_flag} on 
  \Id{CVDENSE\_JACFUNC\_UNRECVR}).
}
{
  A user-supplied dense Jacobian function must load the \id{nB} by \id{nB}
  dense matrix \id{JB} with an approximation to the Jacobian matrix
  at the point (\id{t},\id{y},\id{yB}), where \id{y} is the solution
  of the original IVP at time \id{t} and \id{yB} is the solution of the
  backward problem at the same time.
  Only nonzero elements need to be loaded into \id{JB} as this matrix 
  is set to zero before the call to the Jacobian function. 
  The type of \id{JB} is \Id{DenseMat}. The user is referred to 
  \S\ref{ss:djacFn} for details regarding accessing a \id{DenseMat} object.

  {\warn}Before calling the user's \id{CVDenseJacFnB}, {\cvodea} needs to evaluate

If the direct linear solver with banded treatment of the Jacobian is selected
for the backward problem (i.e. \Id{CVBandB} is called in step \ref{i:lin_solverB} 
of \S\ref{ss:skeleton_adj}), the user may provide, through a call to \id{CVBandSetJacFnB}

  with the result of the product between the Jacobian of the backward problem 
  at the point (\id{t},\id{y}, \id{yB}) and the vector \id{vB}. 
  Here, \id{y} is the solution of the original IVP at time \id{t} and 
  \id{yB} is the solution of the backward problem at the same time.  
  The rest of the arguments are equivalent to those passed to a function of type
  \id{CVSpilsJacTimesVecFn} (see \S\ref{ss:jtimesFn}).
  If the backward problem is the adjoint of ${\dot y} = f(t, y)$, then this 
  function is to compute $-(\dfdyI)^T v_B$.

\section{Using CVODES preconditioner modules for the backward problem}
%%-------------------------------------------------------------------
%%-------------------------------------------------------------------
%%

As on the forward integration phase, the efficiency of Krylov iterative methods 
for the solution of linear systems can be greatly enhanced through preconditioning.
Both preconditioner modules provided with {\sundials}, the banded
preconditioner {\cvbandpre} and the band-block-diagonal preconditioner module {\cvbbdpre},
provide interface functions through which they can be used on the backward integration phase.

%%-------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Using the banded preconditioner CVBANDPRE}
%%-------------------------------------------------------------------

\index{CVBANDPRE@{\cvbandpre} preconditioner!usage with adjoint module|(}
The adjoint module in {\cvodes} offers an interface to the banded 
preconditioner module {\cvbandpre} described in section \S\ref{sss:cvbandpre}.
This preconditioner provides a band matrix preconditioner based on difference
quotients of the backward problem right-hand side function \id{fB}. It generates
a banded approximation to the Jacobian with $m_{lB}$ sub-diagonals and $m_{uB}$
super-diagonals to be used with one of the Krylov linear solvers.

In order to use the {\cvbandpre} module in the solution of the backward problem,
the user need not define any additional functions. First, the user must initialize the
{\cvbandpre} module by calling
%%

To deallocate the {\cvbbdpre} preconditioner module memory used for the
backward integration, make the following call:
%%
\ucfunction{CVBBDPrecFreeB}
{
  CVBBDPrecFreeB(cvadj\_mem);
}
{
  The function \ID{CVBBDPrecFreeB} frees the memory allocated by
  \id{CVBBDPrecAllocB}.
}
{
  The only argument passed to \id{CVBBDPrecFreeB} is the pointer to the {\cvodea} 
  memory block (of type \id{void *}).
}
{
  The function \id{CVBBDPrecFreeB} has no return value.
}
{
  The call to \id{CVBBDPrecFreeB} must preceed that to \id{CVadjFree}.

\subsubsection{User-supplied functions for CVBBDPRE}
%%
\index{CVBBDPRE@{\cvbbdpre} preconditioner!user-supplied functions|(}
To use the {\cvbbdpre} module, the user must supply one or two functions which the
module calls to construct the preconditioner: a required function \id{glocB} 
(of type \id{CVLocalFnB}) which approximates the right-hand side of the backward
problem and which is computed locally, and an optional function \id{cfnB} 
(of type \id{CVCommFnB}) which performs all interprocess communication necessary 
to evaluate this approximate right-hand side (see \S\ref{sss:cvbbdpre}).
The prototypes for these two functions are described below.
%%
%%
\usfunction{CVLocalFnB}
{
  typedef int (*CVLocalFnB)(&long int NlocalB, realtype t,  \\
                            &N\_Vector y, N\_Vector yB, N\_Vector gB, \\
                            &void *f\_dataB);
}
{
  This function loads the vector
  \id{gB} as a function of \id{t}, \id{y}, and \id{yB}.  
}
{
  \begin{args}[NlocalB]
  \item[NlocalB] 
    is the local vector length for the backward problem.
  \item[t]
    is the value of the independent variable.
  \item[y]
    is the current value of the forward solution vector.
  \item[yB]
    is the current value of the dependent variable vector.
  \item[gB]
    is the output vector.
  \item[f\_dataB]
    is a pointer to user data - the same as the \Id{f\_dataB}      
    parameter passed to \id{CVodeSetFdataB}.  
  \end{args}
}
{
  A \id{CVLocalFnB} should return 0 if successful, a positive value if a recoverable
  error occurred (in which case {\cvodes} will attempt to correct), or a negative 
  value if it failed unrecoverably (in which case the integration is halted and
  \id{CVodeB} returns \Id{CV\_LSETUP\_FAIL}). 
}
{
  This routine assumes that all interprocess communication of data needed to 
  calculate \id{gB} has already been done, and this data is accessible within
  \id{f\_dataB}.

  {\warn}Before calling the user's \id{CVLocalFnB}, {\cvodea} needs to evaluate
  (through interpolation) the values of the states from the forward integration. 
  If an error occurrs in the interpolation, {\cvodea} triggers an unrecoverable
  failure in the preconditioner setup function which will halt the integration
  (\id{CVodeB} returns \id{CV\_LSETUP\_FAIL}).
}
%%
%%
\usfunction{CVCommFnB}
{
  typedef int (*CVCommFnB)(&long int NlocalB, realtype t,  \\
                           &N\_Vector y, N\_Vector yB, void *f\_dataB);
}
{
  This function performs all interprocess communications necessary 
  for the execution of the \id{glocB} function above, using the input 
  vectors \id{y} and \id{yB}.
}
{
  \begin{args}[NlocalB]
  \item[NlocalB] 
    is the local vector length.
  \item[t]
    is the value of the independent variable.
  \item[y]
    is the current value of the forward solution vector.
  \item[yB]
    is the current value of the dependent variable vector.
  \item[f\_dataB]
    is a pointer to user data - the same as the \Id{f\_dataB}
    parameter passed to \id{CVodeSetFdataB}.
  \end{args}
}
{
  A \id{CVCommFn} should return 0 if successful, a positive value if a recoverable
  error occurred (in which case {\cvodes} will attempt to correct), or a negative 
  value if it failed unrecoverably (in which case the integration is halted and
  \id{CVodeB} returns \Id{CV\_LSETUP\_FAIL}). 
}
{
  The \id{cfnB} function is expected to save communicated data in space defined within the
  structure \id{f\_dataB}. 

  Each call to the \id{cfnB} function is preceded by a call to the function that 
  evaluates the right-hand side of the backward problem with the same \id{t}, \id{y}, 
  and \id{yB} arguments. If there is no additional communication needed, then pass
  \id{cfnB} $=$ \id{NULL} to \id{CVBBDPrecAllocB}.
