Description
This package contains project files needed to compile and build selected packages (shared, nvec_ser and cvode) Sundials V2.2.0 using Microsoft Visual C++ .NET (VC7.1). 

Instructions
1. Download the Sundials V2.2.0 tarball and unpack it. 
2. Create the folders Build, include and Projects at the Sundials root level (same level as config, cvode etc).
3. Generate or get a copy of sundials_config.h and put it inside include. Consult Sundials documentation on how to generate this file.
4. Extract the contents of the current package under Projects. It produces these files:
	- README (this file)
	- VC7.1\cvode.vcproj
	- VC7.1\nvec_ser.vcproj
	- VC7.1\shared.vcproj
	- VC7.1\sundials.sln
5. Launch VC7.1; File->"Open Solution" and open sundials.sln. Make the builds.
	Each of the 3 vcproj files have 'debug' and 'release' as configurations. 
	The resulting binaries are deposited in the Build folder.

FAQ
1. Does this work with VC8?
	No. VC8 project file formats are incompatible and I don't have VC8.
2. Does this work with VC*?
	I have only used it on my Visual C++, which is Version 7.1.3088 with .NET Framework 1.1 Version 1.1.4322 SP1. I would expect it to work with any VC7 builds more recent that that, but I have no way to find out.
3. Are project files for other Sundials packages available?
	No. I only use and make the packages I built. However, one should be able to use the existing ones as templates for the others.
