- passing mxstep<0 to ***SetMaxNumSteps disables checking nstloc>=mxstep.
  (this option is useful in some applications but may be dangereous so maybe it
  should not be documented?)

- added gactive array for rootfinding. 
  Removed INITROOT return flag from Rcheck1 and error return from CVode if
  some g is zero at and close to the initial time (such event functions are
  'deactivated' until they move away from 0).
  However, if after the first successful step there still are 'inactive'
  event functions, a warning is issued to the user since this may indicate
  a bug in the implementation of the root function. This warning is issued 
  only once and can be completely disabled by calling ***SetNoInactiveRootWarn)
