<p class="pageheading">Perl Script for Password Protecting a Web Site</p>

<p>This simple Perl script allows you to provide password protection for part of 
a web site, for those who do not have access to their web server's 
implementation of the HTTP basic authentication scheme. It works in conjunction  
with a JavaScript function which is called in the header of each protected web 
page.</p>

<p>The functionality protects against a casual attempt to access protected 
pages, but because it requires JavaScript to be enabled in the user's browser, 
it shouldn't be considered for anything where security is a critical issue.</p>

<p>It assumes that access to the protected part of the web site is through an
entry page, with a form containing a password prompt:</p>

<form id="myform" action="http://www.braemoor.co.uk/cgi-bin/passwords.cgi" method="post">
<p>Try it: (passwords are <span style="color: #ff0000;">xyzzy, abcdef, 123456):</span> 
<span style="color: #ff0000; margin-left: 20px;">Enter password: 
<input type="password" name="password" maxlength="12" size="12" style="margin-left: 10px;" />
<input type="submit"  value = "Submit" style="margin-left: 30px; color: #f00;" />
</span></p>
</form>

<p>The normal route through the Perl script when called as above simply checks 
the given password against one contained within the script, and displays either  
the required entry web page of the protected part of the site, or reports that 
an invalid password has been given. The script allows for multiple passwords / 
entry web page combinations.</p>

<p>The script also sets up a cookie, which may be interrogated by the JavaScript 
function inserted in the header of each page of the protected part of the site. 
If a valid password has been previously provided, the page is displayed as 
normal, otherwise an invalid password error is reported.</p>

<p>The basic form is coded as follows (without the styling):</p>

<pre style="font-size: 90%;">
&lt;form id="myform" action="http://www.braemoor.co.uk/cgi-bin/passwords.cgi" method="post">
Enter password: 
&lt;input type="password", name="password", maxlength="12" />
&lt;input type="submit",  value="Submit" />
&lt;form>
</pre>

<p>The password field must be called <em>password</em>, and the <em>action</em> 
attribute must contain the URL for the <em>password.cgi</em> script. If the 
password is valid the CGI script invokes one web page; if it is invalid it 
invokes a second.</p>

<p>The CGI script includes the following lines which determine valid password / 
URL combinations, which should be adjusted to meet your own requirements.</p>

<pre style="font-size: 90%;">
# Set up the password strings and associated URLs.
my %urlList = ("xyzzy" => "http://www.braemoor.co.uk/software/valid.html",
               "abcdef" => "http://www.braemoor.co.uk/software/valid.html",
               "a12345" => "http://www.braemoor.co.uk/software/valid.html"
              );

# Set up the invalid URL      
my $invalidurl = "http://www.braemoor.co.uk/software/invalid.html";
</pre>

<p>You should also ensure that the script is given appropriate access protection 
(#755 on *nix systems).</p>

<p>The JavaScript code which should be incorporated in the header of each of 
the protected pages, has the following line, which should be modified to reflect
your own requirements:</p>

<pre style="font-size: 90%;">
var invalidurl = "http://braemoor.co.uk/software/invalid.html";
