#       Login is a simple password protection script that I have     #
#       written on request by many different people.  This script    #
#       is only intended to be a simple password protection system.  #
#       This script is not intended to be used to protect anything   #
#       that needs high level security.  I take no responsibility    #
#       for stolen or lost data because of this script.              #
#       Generally, just use this at your own risk.  Now enjoy!       #
#                                                                    #
#     How to set up:                                                 #
#      1) Put login.cgi where it can be run from the web.  This may  #
#         just be in your directory or it my be in your server's     #
#         cgi-bin area.                                              #
#      2) chmod 755 login.cgi     (make login.cgi executable)        #
#      3) configure login.cgi     (edit it)                          #
#      4) chmod 777 log           (make the log file editable)       #
#      5) If you use this script, please tell me your URL and I will #
#         make a link to you from my pages!                          #
#                                                                    #
