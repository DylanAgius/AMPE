Build system updates:
- do not create separate libraries with the Blas/Lapack interfaces
  anymore. Instead, if this option is enabled at configuration and if
  the appropriate libraries are found, then:
  - the solver libraries include the objects with the interface functions.
  - the ***_lapack.h headers are exported
  - the examples using this linear solver module are built and
    (if requested) installed and the exported examples Makefiles are
    correspondingly modified
- removed separate configuration top file for development version.
  Instead, we rely on testing for the existence of certain directories
  in order to enable/disable the test examples. Also, configuration
  of solvers not yet released (CPODES) is done conditionally on the
  existence of the corresponding subdirectory in src/
